'''  Method 1: Using Simple Iteration
Working
In this method weâ€™ll use the concept of loops to repeat the process of breaking down the number and adding it back in the reverse order.

For a given integer variable number we perform the following,

        Run a while loop with the condition number >0.
        Extract the last digit as Remainder using Modulo operator.
        Using the formula reverse = ( reverse * 10 ) + remainder , we keep changing the reverse value.
        Break down the Nunber using divide operator.
        Print the reverse variable.   
'''
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = num
reverse = 0
while num > 0:
    remainder = num % 10
    reverse = (reverse * 10) + remainder
    num = num // 10

print(f"Reversed Number: {reverse}")
